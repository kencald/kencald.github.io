        <h1>Value proposition</h1>
        
        <p>I am a content person. I write, structure, and style content that is comprehensible and compelling.</p>
        
        <h2>What makes me different</h2>
        
        <p>My background is in creative art, a discipline of planning, craft, and constant practice.</p>
        
        <p>My degree in creative writing and literature cultivated my skill in critical thinking, expository writing, and public speaking.</p>
        
        <p>Applying those skills as a professional led me to marketing and business communications where I learned to become a valuable member of team-based projects.</p>
        
        <p>As a print designer, I earned the distinction of Adobe Certified Expert - Design Specialist (InDesign, Illustrator, Acrobat, & Photoshop).</p>
        
        <p>Today, I'm bringing all of my skills together as a creative artist, problem solver, technologist, and team member.</p>
