    <h1>User Experience Research &amp; Design</h1>
    <p>Here is a sample of my work.</p>

    <h3>Social media content strategy</h3>
    <p>This summer 2018, in my role at U-M Information and Technology Services, I initiated a content strategy project to reinvigorate ITS’s use of Twitter as supported by quantitative research. I created a project charge, sought leadership approval, then led a team of interns through a crash-course in UX research methodology. The structure I imposed included periods of scoping and discovery, audience analysis, and content design. Ultimately, we produced a set of detailed guidelines for contributing staff writers to build engagement with the target audience.</p>

    <h3>UMSI Design Clinic (now infoLab)</h3>
    <p>In winter 2018, I volunteered for UMSI Design Clinic to bring my user experience research and design skills to fruition outside of the classroom. What an experience! I learned so much through a rigorous research process: qualitative interviews, card sorting exercises, comparative user tests, and more. I even contributed to the team’s more concrete deliverables like a user journey and a web-based, interactive prototype for our client—a student startup called Canopy.</p>

    <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
    <p>In fall 2017, I worked in a consulting capacity as a student of SI 501 to study the internal team dynamics at the Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE), part of the U-M College of Engineering. Through the project, my team and I developed research protocols and used tried-and-true methods like affinity diagramming to identify key findings. As the project culminated, I led an in-person meeting to recommend ways their team could more effectively collaborate and communicate. The client was very grateful, noting that our “objective and professional manner prompted conversation that wouldn't have otherwise occurred.”</p>

        <h1>Marketing projects</h1>

        <p>My range of marketing skills includes audience analysis, communication planning, tactical execution, and measurement to ensure a return on investment.</p>

        <h3>Targeted email</h3>
        
        <p>I code HTML and CSS content for targeted email, respond to requests, and recommend ways to engage our audience through periodic communications. I have extensive experience with Arial Enterprise and some with MailChimp. I also led the exploration of a new targeted email tool for the organization, Emma.</p>

        <h3>Social media strategy</h3>

        <p>As the social lead for @umichTECH, I define the organization's approach to public-facing social content, scheduling, and monitoring. I train staff contributors to write engaging content our target audience wants.</p>

        <h2>Newsletter planning &amp; distribution</h2>

        <p>As a lead administrator of Michigan IT News, I shape the direction of a key source of information for IT professionals across U-M's campuses. That includes serving as an administrator of our WordPress account, and preparing and sending a monthly email newsletter on behalf of the Office of the VPIT-CIO.</p>

        Michigan Ross Positive Business Calendar
2016
As a way to showcase the success and impact of the Michigan Ross Positive Business program, I was contracted to design a 2016–17 wall calendar themed around “energizing the positive leader in you.” The layout incorporates original staff artwork and quotations inspired by the program.

Book Designer for 826michigan
2014–current
826michigan is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting students aged 6 to 18 with their creative and expository writing skills. I continue to serve 826mi as volunteer book designer, typosetting, and copyeditor to prepare select publications for print.

Heathcare marketing
As sole marketing communications specialist and graphic designer for a subsidiary of a major health care corporation, a lot rested on my shoulders. I learned to adhere to and preserve brand identity through the effective use of logo, typography, color, and imagery. I mastered the principles of print production through dozens of program brochures, sell sheets, newsletters, annual calendars, as well as branded giveaway items.
